## Features

A simple lightweight VSCode Extension for Running Jest Tests specific to Angular Projects Running Typescript and Jest. I loved the **Test Explorer** extension in the way that it allows for you to run the tests with the click of a button. However I found that they were very expensive resource wise and didn't work on lower capacity machines. This extension adds a button to one click run the tests for your current file without holding the weight of the entire directory.

## Requirements

In order for this extension to work your Angular projects package.json must have a script called `test:file` the command for this script is as follows `ng test <project-name> --test-path-pattern`.

### 1.0.0

Super basic but plan to expand on this as I run into different situations.
