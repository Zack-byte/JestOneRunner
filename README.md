## Features

A simple lightweight VSCode Extension for Running Jest Tests specific to Angular Projects Running Typescript and Jest. I loved the **Test Explorer** extension in the way that it allows for you to run the tests with the click of a button. However I found that they were very expensive resource wise and didn't work on lower capacity machines. This extension adds a button to one click run the tests for your current file without holding the weight of the entire directory.

## Usage

Super basic but plan to expand on this as I run into different situations.
